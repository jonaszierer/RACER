Description: In order to investigate and compare regional association data, one may need to create a single plot of a regional association, a scatter plot of the -log10(p-values)s of two studies, or a mirror plot, a plot comparing two sets of -log10(p-value)s that are mirrored across a common x-axis. RACER can be used to create these three types of plots. This package is described further in Sabik and Farber (2018) <doi:10.1101/495366>.
